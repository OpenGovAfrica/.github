## 2. Steering Committee Membership  

**Eligibility:**  
- At least 12 months of consistent contribution (with 6 months as a Maintainer/Core Maintainer).  
- Strong record of transparency, collaboration, and community trust.  
- Willing to commit approximately 5 hours/month for governance work.  

**Selection Process:**  
1. Nomination Phase → Contributors may nominate themselves or be nominated by others.  
2. Review Phase → Existing SC reviews eligibility (contribution history, community trust).  
3. Community Input → Open discussion and Q&A with candidates on Discord.  
4. Election → Community vote (using Loomio, GitHub Issues voting, or similar).  
5. Onboarding → New SC members shadow existing members for 3 months before full responsibilities.  

**Term Length:**  
- 2 years per term.  
- Maximum of 2 consecutive terms (4 years).  
- After stepping down, a member must wait 1 year before re-election.  

**Rotation:**  
- Elections staggered so not all SC members change at once.  
- Ensures continuity while allowing fresh leadership.  

## 3. Responsibilities at Each Level  

- **Contributors** → Do the work (docs, data, tech, outreach).  
- **Maintainers/Team Leads** → Review contributions, coordinate projects, onboard new people.  
- **Core Maintainers** → Cross-team coordination, resolve conflicts, provide strategic input.  
- **Steering Committee** → Final decision-making authority (budgets, partnerships, governance changes).
- **Donors/Partners (Advisory)** → Provide financial sustainability, strategic guidance, and capacity-building support. 

### 4. Donors & Partners in Governance  

OpenGov Africa values collaboration with donors, institutions, and partner organizations. However, **financial support does not automatically translate into governance power.**

**Principles**  
- Only Donors & Financial partners whose donation carry the option of joining the steering committee will be considered.
- The community remains in charge → A majority of the Steering Committee (SC) must always be elected contributors.  
- Donors and partners can advise, not capture → Their role enhances sustainability and partnerships, without overriding citizen leadership.  
- Transparency must guide all relationships → Partner seats are publicly declared with clear limits.  

**Options for Inclusion**  
- **Non-Voting Advisory Council (Preferred):** Donors and partners join a separate Advisory Council. They provide input on funding priorities, partnerships, and long-term sustainability. The Advisory Council meets quarterly with the Steering Committee and reports publicly. Advisory members do not vote on governance decisions.  
- **Observer Seats:** Donors and partners may hold non-voting observer seats on the SC. They can attend meetings, give input, and receive updates, but cannot block or pass decisions. Limited to 1 seat per organization/funder.  
- **Voting Seats (With Safeguards):** To be eligible for Voting seats, representative must have contributed meaningfully to OpenGov Africa beyond funding (knowledge, community support, open data, etc.). All Donors and partners may hold up to 25% of SC seats, never a majority. They must commit to transparency and rotation rules. These seats rotate every 2 years. Example: If SC has 7 members, a maximum of 2 donor/partner representatives may vote. Representatives agree that term limits and rotation apply (same as other SC members).

**Process for Inclusion**  
1. Application/Nomination → Donor/partner in approved tier expresses interest.  
2. Review → SC evaluates alignment with OpenGov Africa’s mission.  
3. Community Input → Open discussion ensures transparency.  
4. Decision → SC votes to grant Advisory, Observer, or Voting status.  
5. Public Disclosure → All donor/partner memberships are published publicly.  

**Term Length**  
- 2 years per term, renewable once.  
- Maximum of 4 consecutive years.  
- After stepping down, a donor/partner must wait 1 year before rejoining governance.  

**Safeguards**  
- Conflict of Interest Policy → Donor/partner SC members cannot vote on issues directly tied to their funding.  
- Transparency Reports → All partner contributions (financial or in-kind) logged publicly.  
- Community Majority Rule → At least 51% of SC votes must always come from elected contributors, not partners.

## 5. Transparency & Accountability  

- All decisions logged in public Docs/Discord channels.  
- Monthly community call for SC updates.  
- Annual public review → Each SC member publishes a “year in review” of their work.  
- Recall process → Community can trigger a vote of no confidence if a member is inactive or violates trust.  

## 6. Time Expectations  

- **Contributor** → approximately 2–5 hrs/month.  
- **Maintainer** → approximately 5–10 hrs/month.  
- **Core Maintainer** → approximately 10–15 hrs/month.  
- **Steering Committee** → approximately 5 hrs/month governance plus community representation.
- **Donor/Partner Advisory Members** → ~2 hrs/quarter (strategic engagement).
