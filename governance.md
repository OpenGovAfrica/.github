## 2. Steering Committee Membership  

**Eligibility:**  
- At least 12 months of consistent contribution (with 6 months as a Maintainer/Core Maintainer).  
- Strong record of transparency, collaboration, and community trust.  
- Willing to commit approximately 5 hours/month for governance work.  

**Selection Process:**  
1. Nomination Phase → Contributors may nominate themselves or be nominated by others.  
2. Review Phase → Existing SC reviews eligibility (contribution history, community trust).  
3. Community Input → Open discussion and Q&A with candidates on Discord.  
4. Election → Community vote (using Loomio, GitHub Issues voting, or similar).  
5. Onboarding → New SC members shadow existing members for 1 month before full responsibilities.  

**Term Length:**  
- 2 years per term.  
- Maximum of 2 consecutive terms (4 years).  
- After stepping down, a member must wait 1 year before re-election.  

**Rotation:**  
- Elections staggered so not all SC members change at once.

- All decisions logged in public Docs/Discord channels.  
- Monthly community call for SC updates.  
- Annual public review → Each SC member publishes a “year in review” of their work.

- Maintainer → approximately 5–10 hrs/month.  
- Core Maintainer → approximately 10–15 hrs/month.
